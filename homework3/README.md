* created by: Mina Gaffney

# Environment info
* This code was written using python 3.12 within a virtual environment
* All required python packages and versions should be in requirements.txt
* Note: this code was developed using pycharm but was tested for compatibility with VS code 

# Github link
* https://github.com/mgaffney-mcw/EECE_6840_Neural_Networks/tree/main/homework3
* Note this repository is currently private. If you would like to be added send me your github username 

# Instructions
* Run EECE_6840_homework_3.py normally or in debugger 
* After tensorflow initializes a popup window will appear where the user can select the NN
* and the optimizer type then select the "save and quit" button 
* Note: Adam optimizer is default and was run as the optimizer for coding prompts 1-3
* I ran out of time to implement the intialization option across all NN's for that question
* select Leaky ReLU He or Leaky ReLU Xavier

* Outputs: test accuracy, plots for gradient norms, and plots for test and training accuracy and loss per epoch

* TODO: clean up the code so it isn't so repetitive... there's some poor coding practices in there
* that I hid behind the gui...I hope it's fine for the sake of class
